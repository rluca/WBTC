Create my own IRI

As we learned last week I try to create my own IRI that could or should also be used in like 100 years. For that I need to take some good patterns.
http://aculrozza.belwag.allkindofsports.lr/#i
My explanation for using this patterns:
aculrozza: 
I wanted to make sure that this pattern refers to me and only to me, so I wrote my first name backwards. I thought if I wrote lrozza there would be others(for example my dad).
Belwag is the name of the Company I made my apprenticeship. So this is also true in 100 years.
My last patterns is more a hashtag but I wasn't sure what to take there.
With that said I think this IRI should be in use 100 years from now.

Linked Data

There are many different Data that we use like Videos or Images. The Web allows us to mix pictures with text. Thanks to links theres a ci√¥nnection between documents. For the Computers is hard to know where the link is refering to or what image it is they only see its a link or image.


I'm referring to the video "What is Linked Data": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x_xzT5eF5Q
