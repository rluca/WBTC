Exercise 1

Create my own IRI

As we learned last week I try to create my own IRI that could or should also be used in like 100 years. For that I need to take some good patterns.
Identifier: http://lrozza.org/info
Company: http://belwag.ch/#i
Interests: http://lrozza.org/info#interests
My explanation for using these patterns:
I wanted to make sure that this pattern refers to me and only to me, so I wrote lrozza (for Luca Rozza) .
Belwag is the name of the Company I made my apprenticeship. This is also true in 100 years.
My last pattern is more a hashtag but I wasn't sure what to take there.
With that said I think this IRI should be in use 100 years from now.

Linked Data

There are many different Data that we use like Videos or Images. The Web allows us to mix pictures with text. Thanks to links there’s a connection between documents. For the Computers don't understand where the link is referring to or what image it is they only see it’s a link or image. There are two problems on the web. Packaging problem: What's the best way to express the Data (HTML,JSON,XML...). Linking problem: What do we use to link the Data? With linked Data the Web becomes a global information repository, which means that you can ask questions like "How many people live in Switzerland". For all that the computer needs URL's. He needs it to link the Data, but we don't see them. For example Google uses linked Data because you can type in a whole question. That said linked Data is used today and it’s really important.


I'm referring to the video "What is Linked Data": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x_xzT5eF5Q
